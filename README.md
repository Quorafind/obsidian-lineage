## Installation
The plugin is currently in early development and is not available in the community plugin store.  
You can test it using [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/brat-quick-guide#Testing+Plugins).

## Usage
The plugin uses HTML comments to structure markdown files.    

To open a file, you can use the file context menu or the command palette.
